========================================================================
	THIS IS THE README FOR HOMEWORK3
========================================================================

Steps:
1. All the files need for duplicating the results:
	Directory Tree & files needed to duplicate the results
	../Upload_HW3_ChengyaoWang/
		main.cpp: 		main function
		ee569_hw3.cpp:		all the source code for Homework3
		ee569_hw3.hpp:		Header file of *.cpp
		hw3_sol.command: 	Shell script
	../DefectDetection/
	../Morph_process/
	../PCB_analysis/
	../Stars_Counting/
	../Stitching/
	../
		All the .raw images

2. Open source code used:
	OpenCV official Library:
		This is only for SURF + FLANN, but may not compile & run other functions if missing.
	Geeks for Geeks:
		This is the original source for matrix inversion.

3. Double click hw3_sol.command file, and will automatically replicate results.
	First line of .command file is used to re-direct to the current directory, change if errors with this respect happen
	Compiler Command: clang++ $(pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4) -std=c++11 main.cpp ee569_hw3.cpp -o main

4. For simplify the checking process of outputted images:
	*.pgm, *.ppm format are used to inspect the intermediate results, they are supported by the MacOS system.
	*.raw files will also be generated by c++ scripts from ".pgm" / ".ppm" files. SOME DIMENSIONS MAY HAVE CHANGED.
	PLEASE REFER TO THE pxm_TO_RAW_ALL() METHOD TO GET THE FINAL DIMENSION INFORMATION.
 
5. Python scripts are also uploaded, and there are 4 of them.
	They mainly to guide the debugging tool for matrix inversion in c++.
	And also, some visualization graphs presented in the report.

6. Just neglect DeprecatedCode.cpp file. This file stores the wrong code.
  
7. 	Please contact my email if any error happens.
	Sadly, I cannot foresee every one of them :(
	Also, OpenCV doesn't support outputting *.raw image :( thus here's *pgm on its behalf.
