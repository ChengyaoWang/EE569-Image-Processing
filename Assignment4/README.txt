========================================================================
	THIS IS THE README FOR HOMEWORK4
========================================================================

Steps:
1. All the files need for duplicating the results:
	Directory Tree & files needed to duplicate the results
	../Upload_HW4_ChengyaoWang/
		main.cpp: 		main function
		Matrix_ToolBox.cpp:	all the source code for matrix toolbox
		Matrix_ToolBox.hpp:	Header file of *.cpp
		MyUtils.cpp:		all the utility function, declaration for myKernel
		MyUtils.hpp:		Header file of *.cpp
		ee569_hw4.cpp:		all the source code for Homework4
		ee569_hw4.hpp:		Header file of *.cpp
		hw4_sol.command: 	Shell script
	../SegTuneResult/
	../scrRaw/			All the .raw images
	../scrPxm/			Intermediate image format

2. Open source code used:
	OpenCV official Library:
		For feature matching, SVM, Random Forest, SIFT.
	Eigen3:
		For SVD.

3. Double click hw4_sol.command file, and will automatically replicate results.
	First line of .command file is used to re-direct to the current directory, change if errors with this respect happen
	Compiler Command: 
		clang++ $(pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4 eigen3) -std=c++11 main.cpp Matrix_ToolBox.cpp MyUtils.cpp ee569_hw4.cpp -o main

4. For simplify the checking process of outputted images:
	*.pgm, *.ppm format are used to inspect the intermediate results, they are supported by the MacOS system.
	*.raw files will also be generated by c++ scripts from ".pgm" / ".ppm" files. SOME DIMENSIONS MAY HAVE CHANGED.
	There only segmentation result here needs conversion back to *.raw
 
5. Python scripts are also uploaded, and there are 2 of them.
	Toy1.py conducts the task of visualization (Total of 2)
	Toy2.py mainly serves to provide reference for SIFT result in C++.
  
6. 	Please contact my email if any error happens.
	Sadly, I cannot foresee every one of them :(
	Also, OpenCV doesn't support outputting *.raw image :( thus here's *pgm on its behalf.
